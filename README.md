### Introduction ###

Our main object is to solve algorithmic problems. It becomes very easy if we can divide the problem into the following
to-do lists.


### Steps involved in solving a problem? ###

    *1 Constrains evaluation

    *2 Idea Generation (Time & Space Complexity)
        *2.1 Idea #1
        *2.2 Idea #2

    *3 Code Implementation

    *4 Test Cases
        *4.1 Functiona Test [Positive]
        *4.2 Functiona Test [Negative]
        *4.3 Edge Case Test
        *4.4 No Solution Test
        *4.5 Extensive Test
